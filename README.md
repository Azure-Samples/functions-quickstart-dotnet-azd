# Azure Functions C# HTTP Trigger using AZD

This sample template provides a set of basic HTTP trigger functions in C# (isolated process mode) that are ready to run locally and can be easily deployed to a function app in Azure Functions.  

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=836901178)

## Run in your local environment

The project is designed to run on your local computer, provided you have met the [required prerequisites](#prerequisites). You can run the project locally in these environments:

+ [Using Azure Functions Core Tools (CLI)](#using-azure-functions-core-tools-cli)
+ [Using Visual Studio](#using-visual-studio)
+ [Using Visual Studio Code](#using-visual-studio-code)

### Prerequisites

+ [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) 
+ [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Cmacos%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
+ Start Azurite storage emulator. See [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) for how to configure and start the Azurite emulator for Local Storage.

### Prepare your local environment
1) Create a file named `local.settings.json` in FunctionHttp directory and add the following:
```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated"
    }
}
```

### Using Azure Functions Core Tools (CLI)

1) Open a new terminal and do the following:

```bash
cd FunctionHttp
func start
```

2) Test a Web hook or GET using the browser to open http://localhost:7071/api/httpget

3) Test a POST using your favorite REST client, e.g. [RestClient in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client), PostMan, curl. `test.http` has been provided to run this quickly.
Or in a new terminal run the following:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:7071/api/httppost \
  -H "Content-Type: text/json" \
  --data-binary  "@testdata.json"
```

### Using Visual Studio

1) Open `FunctionHttp.sln` using Visual Studio 2022 or later.
3) Press Run/F5 to run in the debugger
4) Use same approach above to test using an HTTP REST client (note the port may be different than 7071)

### Using Visual Studio Code

1) Open this folder in a new terminal
2) Open VS Code by entering `code .` in the terminal
3) Make sure the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) is installed
4) Add required files to the `.vscode` folder by opening the command palette using `Crtl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and selecting *"Azure Functions: Initialize project for use with VS Code"* (select `starters\http\dotnet\http` project when prompted to set a default)
5) Press Run/Debug (F5) to run in the debugger
6) Use same approach above to test using an HTTP REST client

## Source Code

The key code that makes this work is as follows in `./http/httpGetFunction.cs` and `./http/httpPostBodyFunction.cs`.  The async Run function is marked as an Azure Function using the Function attribute.  This code shows how to handle an ordinary Web hook GET or a POST that sends a `person` object in the request body as JSON.  

```csharp
[Function("httpget")]
public IActionResult Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get")] HttpRequest req)
{
    var name = req.Query["name"];

    var returnValue = string.IsNullOrEmpty(name)
        ? "Hello, World."
        : $"Hello, {name}.";

    return new OkObjectResult(returnValue);
}
```

```csharp
[Function("httppost")]
public IActionResult Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post")] HttpRequest req,
    [FromBody] Person person)
{   
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(person.Name))
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request with no name provided.");
        return new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name in the request body.");
    }
    
    _logger.LogInformation($"C# HTTP trigger function processed a request for {person.Name}!");
    return new OkObjectResult(person);
}
```

## Deploy to Azure

The easiest way to deploy this app is using the [Azure Dev CLI aka AZD](https://aka.ms/azd).  If you open this repo in GitHub CodeSpaces the AZD tooling is already preinstalled.

To provision:

```bash
azd up
```

Note that `azd deploy` and Visual Studio does not yet work to publish Flex Consumption apps. Please use Azure Functions Core Tools, Az CLI or VS Code alternatives instead to deploy your app zip to these Flex resources.
